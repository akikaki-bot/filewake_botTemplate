 },
 run: (interaction, client) => {
    interaction.reply('Hi')
  }
}

### Trouble Shooting of SumCheck

```
[SumCheck] Infomation : Command Name (CommandName) is not description.
```
This is an error thrown when no description is attached in the command file. 
There is nothing that doesn't work, but it may not appear in the help command, so be sure to attach a description.

```
[SumCheck] Warning : Commandfile (fileName) is not js file. Please check this.
```
This is a warning thrown when the command file contains something that does not have a js extension.
This bot only supports js extensions.

```

```
This is a registed the slashcommand send a infomation in console.

```
[SumCheck] Warning : Commandfile in not RUN function. Please check this.
```
This is an error that occurs when the command file is set normally but the execution part does not exist.
